# Introduction

This sample project only exists to illustrate the issue IDEA-258659 of intelliJ
Since the version 2020.3 this sample project cannot be built by the IDE when it can with former (2020.2.4) or by maven.

# How it works

Using a problematic version of IntelliJ, just "rebuild" the project, and it will fail.
